# Front-End

### Frontend Integration with Metamask

#### Overview

The frontend integration with Metamask facilitates user authentication and transaction management within the application using the Metamask wallet. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the implemented and pending parts of the integration.

#### Implemented Parts

1. **Metamask Login**:
   * Users can sign in to the application using their Metamask wallet.
   * Upon signing in, the application requests permission from Metamask to access the user's Ethereum address.
   * Metamask prompts the user to confirm the request, and upon approval, the application retrieves the user's Ethereum address.

#### Not Implemented Parts

1. **Transaction Handling**:
   * Backend implementation for handling user transactions, including depositing funds, submitting transactions, and executing transactions, is pending.
   * The frontend will need to interact with the backend to initiate and manage these transactions securely.
2. **User Interactions with Metamask**:
   * Frontend implementation for enabling users to interact with Metamask for various actions such as depositing funds, confirming transactions, and executing transactions is pending.
   * This involves integrating Metamask's JavaScript API into the frontend to trigger Metamask prompts and handle user responses.
3. **User Interface**:
   * Development of user interface components for displaying transaction status, error messages, and interactive Metamask prompts is pending.
   * User-friendly interfaces need to be designed to guide users through the transaction process and provide feedback on their actions.
4. **Security Considerations**:
   * Implementation of security measures to ensure the safety of user transactions and prevent unauthorized access is pending.
   * This includes verifying transaction signatures, enforcing access controls, and implementing secure communication protocols between the frontend, backend, and Metamask.

#### Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**:
   * Develop backend services for handling user transactions securely.
   * Implement APIs for initiating transactions, processing user requests, and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Frontend Development**:
   * Integrate Metamask's JavaScript API into the frontend to enable user interactions with the Metamask wallet.
   * Design and implement user interface components for guiding users through the transaction process and displaying transaction status.
3. **Error Handling**:
   * Implement error handling mechanisms to provide users with feedback on transaction status and handle any errors gracefully.
4. **Security Enhancements**:
   * Implement security measures to protect user transactions, validate transaction signatures, and prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.

#### Conclusion

The frontend integration with Metamask is a crucial aspect of the application, enabling users to securely authenticate and manage transactions using their Metamask wallet. By implementing the remaining functionalities and considering security measures, developers can ensure a seamless and secure user experience for interacting with the application through Metamask.
