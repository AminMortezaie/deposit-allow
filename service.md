# Service

### Wallet Service

The `wallet/service` file contains the `Service` type, responsible for providing wallet-related functionalities and handling requests related to wallets.

### Attributes

* `Repo`: A repository interface providing methods for interacting with wallet data in the database.

### Methods

**SetSession**

```go
func (s *Service) SetSession(c *gin.Context) *entity.Wallet
```

This method retrieves a wallet entity from the repository based on the provided wallet address in the request context.

**GenerateNonce**

```go
func GenerateNonce(c *gin.Context)
```

This function generates a nonce and returns it as a JSON response. It is typically used for authentication and security purposes.

**GetCreateWallet**

```go
func (s *Service) GetCreateWallet(address, signature string) *entity.Wallet
```

This method retrieves a wallet entity from the repository based on the provided address. If the wallet does not exist, it creates a new wallet entity with the provided address and signature.

**LoginWallet**

```go
func (s *Service) LoginWallet(address string)
```

This method updates the login timestamp of a wallet entity in the repository based on the provided wallet address.

**ValidateSignature**

```go
func (s *Service) ValidateSignature(signature string) (string, bool)
```

This method validates a signature by retrieving the corresponding wallet entity from the repository based on the provided signature. If the wallet exists, it returns the wallet address and `true`; otherwise, it returns an empty string and `false`.

### Transaction Service

The `transaction/service` file contains the `Service` type, which is currently empty, as there are no specific functionalities implemented for transaction handling in this service.

#### Attributes

* `Repo`: A repository interface, currently not implemented for transaction-related functionalities.

#### Methods

No methods are implemented in the `transaction/service` file at present, as it serves as a placeholder for future transaction-related functionalities.

### Conclusion

The service files in the `wallet` and `transaction` folders provide an essential layer for implementing business logic and handling requests related to wallet and transaction functionalities, respectively. By leveraging the service layer, developers can abstract database interactions and encapsulate complex logic, promoting modularity and maintainability in the application architecture.
